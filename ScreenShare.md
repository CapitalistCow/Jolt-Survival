## This file will be used to understand the concepts of screen sharing (SS) and associated guidelines.

Screen Sharing is a process used commonly in Minecraft PVP servers when a staff member believes that the suspected player is cheating.  \
Some processes of SS use a remote desktop application (AnyDesk), however, Jolt Survival SS's will be conducted over Discord and involve \
the staff member guiding the suspected player through the process described below.  If at any point the suspected player delays or otherwise \
attempts to invalidate the SS session, they may be subjest to the banning guidelines and to the staff member's discression.  Please refer to the \
staff chat within Discord for any session-specific questions and comments.  \

## Steps: \
1. Inform the player that they are suspected of cheating and have them being a SS session within the Jolt Survival Discord. \
2. While the player is in the game, have them press F3 for the debug menu.  Check that the game version and name match the launcher version and name. \
3. Have them enter their settings and go to controls.  Look for any odd controls and non-vanilla controls sections. \
4. Go to snooper settings and check to bottom of this settings page. \
5. Enter texture packs and look for x-ray packs \
6. Have the suspected player relog to the server.  Look for any buttons within the title screen. \
7. **After a relog** Open controls and bind left click to various other buttons such as: RShift, LControl, BACKSPACE, ect.  Look for unusual functionalities.  \
Have them destroy a specific block. \
8. Check the trash bin
These next steps are operating system specific. \
9a. Press windows+r and type %APPDATA%.  Then open .minecraft
9b. Open finder (command+shift+g) and type: /Users/account name/Library/Application Support/minecraft
